		<p> Rayana is a designer and strategist with a background in copywriting, PR, graphic design, and marketing—bringing a well-rounded perspective across communications and lifestyle industries.
			Currently pursuing a master’s in Digital Product Design at Parsons School of Design (graduating May 2025), she’s focused on bridging strategic thinking with creative execution to design digital products that are both functional and emotionally resonant. </p>
		<p> Rayana’s approach to UX is deeply informed by her experience in creative coding—giving her the tools to not only design thoughtful user experiences, but also prototype them in ways that are responsive, interactive, and technically informed. Understanding how interfaces are built allows her to think more critically about usability, accessibility, and feasibility from the start.</p>
			<p> Across all her projects, Rayana brings an entrepreneurial mindset and a user-centered approach—guiding businesses through research, strategy, and design with the goal of crafting meaningful, business-savvy solutions. Whether consulting, designing, or marketing, she thrives at the intersection of lifestyle, digital innovation, and brand storytelling.</p>
